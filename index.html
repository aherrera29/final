  <h2>Satoru Gojo</h2>
  <h3>"Throughout Heaven and Earth, I Alone Am The Honored One" -Satoru Gojo</h3>
  <p>Satoru Gojo is a confident, powerful, and often playful figure who outwardly exudes arrogance but harbors a deep sense of responsibility. While his immense strength has left him feeling isolated, his core mission is to reform the corrupt jujutsu society, which he sees as unjust and outdated. He takes his role as a mentor seriously, hoping to guide his students toward building a better future. Gojoâ€™s past, especially his fractured friendship with Suguru Geto, shapes his belief in protecting the weak and challenging authority. Despite his carefree demeanor, Gojo is driven by a strong moral compass, aiming to create a more just world.</p>
